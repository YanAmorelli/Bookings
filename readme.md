This repository is based on [Building Modern Web Applications with Go - Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/building-modern-web-applications-with-go/). Here I'm learning the concepts of golang and creating some cool features, besides that, when I'm curious about something or whenever I have doubts I search some articles to better understand and put in [references.md](https://github.com/YanAmorelli/Bookings/blob/master/references.md). 

To run the code on Windows, type:
``` 
go run ./cmd/web/.
```
